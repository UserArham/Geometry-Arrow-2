Geometry Arrow 2 — the sequel to the dynamic arcade game about an arrow navigating through a dangerous cave.

The goal is simple: reach the end of the cave and survive. Along the way, you'll have to dodge a variety of unique and challenging obstacles.

In this new chapter, a second playable character — the Wheel — joins the adventure!
You can now customize your arrow and wheel with different skins, as well as change particle effects and block textures to make the game feel truly yours.

The game features 6 levels with increasing difficulty. Each level combines both Arrow and Wheel gameplay segments, offering variety and challenge.

Unlock achievements as you progress and show off your skills!
